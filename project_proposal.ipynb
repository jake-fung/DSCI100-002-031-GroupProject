    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease is a general term for a variety of conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. These conditions can damage your heart, restrict blood flow, and lead to serious complications, including heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. With 20.5 million U.S. adults have coronary artery disease, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "Age is a major risk factor for heart disease due to several factors. Arteries stiffen and weaken, reducing blood flow and putting strain on the heart. Plaque buildup in arteries worsens with age, further restricting blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke (Rodgers, J. L. et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "Chronically high blood pressure significantly increases the risk of heart disease in several ways. It forces the heart to work harder, potentially leading to heart failure (World Health Organization, 2020). It can also damage arteries, making them more prone to plaque buildup and narrowing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "High levels of LDL cholesterol, often called \"bad\" cholesterol, can contribute to heart disease by accumulating in arteries and forming plaque. This plaque narrows the arteries, reducing blood flow and increasing the risk of complications like chest pain, blood clots, heart attack, and stroke(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the research our team found, we will be using the UC Irvine Heart Disease dataset in order to answer the following research quesion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question:** Can we classify if a patient has heart disease based on age, blood pressure and cholestrol? "

Based on previous research, we are aware that cholesterol, blood pressure, and age have a significant affect on your health, but specifically the likelihood of having heart disease. With our research, we wish to determine if we can classify if a person has heart disease based on the values of those variables. The impact of this is that we can become aware of any serious health issues that may arise before it is too late. If we are successful in determining the relationship between these variables, in the future we could add more factors to these predictions and find out if there are more outstanding factors that contribute to having heart disease.\n"
